# Web Component DevTools

Web Component DevTools is aimed at all developers working with Web Components. 
The tooling provided creates a new Chrome Devtools panel, which allows a quick look at the custom elements on the current page, and enables modification of attributes and properties of said components.

Web Component DevTools works best when combined with the use of a [Custom Elements Manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest). To enable analysis on your project, use a analyzer like the [Open-WC Custom Elements Analyzer](https://github.com/open-wc/custom-elements-manifest/tree/master/packages/analyzer)

Web Component DevTools also works with libraries built for developing Web Components. Currently the libraries, with extra support by DevTools are:

-   [Lit](https://github.com/lit/lit/)

The list of extra support libraries will grow as adoption grows

Issues:

Any issues you run into while using the DevTools should be submitted to the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/Matsuuu/web-component-devtools/issues).
