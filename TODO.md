- Inspection action => Needs to go to DOM, get the current properties, pass them back with data types etc.


TODO next:

- Make the tree closeable from branches
- Make the highlighting maybe prettier
- Add some icons for closing etc.

- Could we get the event listeners of objects?
- Separate parsers and onupdates to their own modules?
