- File tree for components
- Inspection action => Needs to go to DOM, get the current properties, pass them back with data types etc.


TODO next:

- Look into creating parsers for HTMLELement, later on maybe svelte, etc.
    - For HTMLElement could we get by with just `observedAttributes`?
    

- Could we get the event listeners of objects?

- Separate parsers and onupdates to their own modules?

- Rename connection types to channels
- Finish writing nydus so that the connections don't last over refreshes in the background
